# Portfolio Version 2 (University Project)

📘 **Portfolio Version 2** was developed as part of one of my university coursework projects. Building on the basics learned from my first portfolio, this version reflects a more structured and intentional approach to layout, content organization, and visual consistency.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to:

* Apply **academic web development principles** in a real-world project
* Improve semantic HTML usage
* Explore cleaner CSS structuring and layout techniques
* Demonstrate progress beyond beginner-level experimentation

This portfolio served as both an **assessment submission** and a stepping stone toward more polished personal projects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – Semantic structure and content
* **CSS3** – Layout, styling, and visual hierarchy
* **No frameworks or libraries**
* **No JavaScript**

The restriction to pure HTML and CSS was intentional and aligned with the university module requirements.

## 🎨 Improvements Over Version 1

Compared to my first portfolio, this version shows:

* Better **content hierarchy and spacing**

* Improved navigation structure
* Cleaner separation of content and presentation

While still not representative of my current skill level, it clearly demonstrates measurable growth.

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

This portfolio marks the transition from *self-taught experimentation* to *academically guided development*. It represents a phase where I began thinking more critically about usability, structure, and maintainability.

Keeping this version live helps document that progression honestly.
